# **Facial-Emotion-Recognition**

## **Overview**
This project implements a **real-time facial emotion detection system** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The system can identify emotions like **happiness**, **sadness**, **anger**, **surprise**, and others based on live video feed from a camera.

### **Key Features:**
- **Real-Time Emotion Classification**: Detects emotions from live video streams.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves **80% accuracy** in emotion classification.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Provides immediate feedback on emotions as they are detected.
- **Adaptability**: Performs well under varying lighting conditions and different facial angles.
- **Open-Source**: Fully open for modifications and improvements.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Core programming language for model development.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **OpenCV**: Used for facial detection and handling video input.
- **Pre-trained Datasets**: FER-2013, AffectNet for training the model.

## **Installation**
