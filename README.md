# **Facial-Emotion-Recognition**

## **Overview**
This project implements a **real-time facial emotion detection system** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The system can identify emotions like **happiness**, **sadness**, **anger**, **surprise**, and others based on live video feed from a camera.

### **Key Features:**
- **Real-Time Emotion Classification**: Detects emotions from live video streams.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves **80% accuracy** in emotion classification.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Provides immediate feedback on emotions as they are detected.
- **Adaptability**: Performs well under varying lighting conditions and different facial angles.
- **Open-Source**: Fully open for modifications and improvements.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Core programming language for model development.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **OpenCV**: Used for facial detection and handling video input.
- **Pre-trained Datasets**: FER-2013, AffectNet for training the model.

## **Installation**

### **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sujeethsundaram/Facial-Emotion-Recognition.git

Install dependencies:
To install the required Python libraries, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Required Libraries:
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

TensorFlow (for CNN implementation)
Keras (for deep learning layers and model training)
OpenCV (for image and video processing)
NumPy, Matplotlib (for data handling and visualization)
Usage
Running the Program:
After setting up, run the main application using:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
The system will start the camera feed and display the predicted emotion in real-time based on the detected facial expression.
Model Input:
The model processes grayscale images from the webcam and performs emotion classification based on the detected face.
Sample Output:
When a face is detected, the model will output one of the following emotions:

Happy
Sad
Surprise
Anger
Neutral
These results will appear on the screen in real-time as the video feed progresses.

Future Improvements
Data Augmentation: Enhance the model's ability to generalize better in varying conditions.
Mobile Optimization: Adapt the system to run efficiently on mobile devices with limited resources.
Additional Emotion Recognition: Add more nuanced emotion categories such as fear and disgust.
Advanced Error Handling: Improve the system to better handle edge cases like occlusions or partially visible faces.
